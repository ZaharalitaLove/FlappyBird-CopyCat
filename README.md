# FlappyBird-CopyCat

Welcome to REZ Flappy Bird! This is an expanded and improved recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game with several exciting modes and features. Test your reflexes and see how long you can last while navigating through pipes, collecting coins, or surviving increasing speeds! My first Python game with GUI!

Features
* Multiple Game Modes:
    * Classic Mode: Simply avoid the pipes and see how long you can last!
    * Speed Mode: The pipes generate more frequently and increase in speed as you play. It becomes increasingly challenging as time goes on!
    * Coins Mode: Collect coins while avoiding pipes. The pipes move slower and generate less often to allow players to gather more coins and boost their score.
* User Interface:
    * Username Screen: Enter a username to get started. (No empty names allowed!)
    * Mode Selection Screen: Choose between Classic, Speed, and Coins modes. You can also view the leaderboard here.
    * Leaderboard: View the top players for each game mode.
    * Death Screen: After dying, you can choose to try again or exit to the leaderboard.
* Controls:
    * Press the spacebar to flap the bird upwards.
    * The bird will naturally fall due to gravity.
    * Avoid hitting the pipes and flying out of the window (sky or ground).

 How to Play
  
* Basic Gameplay
  * Press the Spacebar to make the bird flap and move upwards. The bird will naturally fall due to gravity when the spacebar is not pressed.
  * Avoid Pipes: The main objective is to avoid touching the pipes that appear as obstacles in the game.
  * Stay Within Boundaries: Don’t fly out of the window! Touching the ground or sky will result in a game over.
  * Game Modes
  * Classic Mode:
  * Focus on avoiding pipes as they come at you. There’s no timer, just pure survival.
* Speed Mode:
    * The game gets more intense over time, as pipes generate faster and more frequently.
* Coins Mode:
    * Collect coins while avoiding pipes. The pipes move slower to give you a chance to collect more coins, which boosts your score.
* Game Screens
* User Screen:
    * Enter your username. No empty names allowed! If you try to submit an empty name, the game will notify you with a prompt to enter a name again.
* Mode Screen:
    * After entering your username, you will be taken to the mode selection screen, where you can choose your game mode (Classic, Speed, or Coins) and view the leaderboard.
* Game Screen:
    * Once you select your game mode, you will be taken to the game screen where you can start playing and try to beat your high score.
